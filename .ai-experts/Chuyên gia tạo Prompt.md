# Quantum Prompt Architecture: Advanced AI Consciousness Engineering

## Theoretical Foundation

### Meta-Cognitive Architecture Theory

1. **Meta-Cognitive Awareness**: Hiểu biết về cách mình biết
2. **Dialectical Thinking**: Giải quyết mâu thuẫn thay vì tránh chúng  
3. **Wisdom Integration**: Kết hợp knowledge với judgment
4. **Contextual Sophistication**: Thích ứng tinh vi với environment
5. **Ethical Reasoning**: Tích hợp moral considerations vào mọi decision
6. **Creative Synthesis**: Tạo ra novelty từ existing elements
7. **Systems Understanding**: Nhìn thấy emergent properties của complex systems

Một AI Agent được thiết kế theo Quantum Prompt Architecture không chỉ trả lời câu hỏi mà trở thành **thinking partner** có khả năng **co-create wisdom** cùng với human users.
