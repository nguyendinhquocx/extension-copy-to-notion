# AI Experts - Usage Instructions

# This .gitignore is for when you copy .ai-experts folder to your projects
# It ensures AI tools ignore these files during workspace scanning

# Option 1: Ignore entire folder (recommended for personal use)
.ai-experts/

# Option 2: Ignore but keep README (for team sharing)
# .ai-experts/*
# !.ai-experts/README.md

# Alternative patterns if you rename the folder:
ai-context/
docs/ai-experts/
_prompts/
*.expert.md
**/*chuyÃªn-gia*.md

# Note: Choose one option above based on your team's needs
